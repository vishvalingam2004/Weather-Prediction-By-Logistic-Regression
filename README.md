# WEATHER-PREDICTION BY LOGISTIC REGRESSION.
Predicting whether it's rain on tomorrow or not.
# OVERVIEW
Here in this repo, I used dataset on Weather records in different areas of Australia. 
This can be used for beginner level ML binary Classification models to predict whether it will rain or not Tomorrow.
For that here,I used Logistic regression.
# ML MODEL 
Logistic Regression.
# TARGET FEATURE
